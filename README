This folder contains code for a CUDA-implementation of simple molecular dynamics routines.
I'm reducing the scope to an NVE algorithm rather than an
entire biophysical simulation with complicated boundary conditions and energy functions.
I'll keep my interaction simple, using purely repulsive forces.

Since this is a CUDA program, this should be run on GPU-enabled systems.

I will initialize a simulation and the requisite parts on the Host CPU,
then run force calculation and integration on the Host CPU. As I progress
through the project, I will replace the following functions with CUDA kernels:

vertexRepulsiveForces2D -> vertexRepulsiveForces2D

The Final Project report will consist of compilation and running instructions, my results from benchmarking
the size-dependence of my simulation reported in wallclock time, and a description of my serial and parallel
algorithms.

I have not decided whether to do this on my own GPU or using a GPU on Grace.
