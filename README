This folder contains code for a CUDA-implementation of simple molecular dynamics routines.
I'm reducing the scope to a FIRE-relaxation algorithm and a NVE algorithm rather than an
entire biophysical simulation with complicated boundary conditions and energy functions.
I'll keep my interaction simple, using purely repulsive forces.

Since this is a CUDA program, this should be run on GPU-enabled systems.

I have two programs. Each will initialize a simulation and the requisite parts on the Host CPU,
then run force calculation and integration or energy minimization also on the Host CPU. As I progress
through the project, I will replace the following functions with CUDA kernels:

FIREMinimize -> cudaFIREMinimize
vertexRepulsiveForces2D -> vertexRepulsiveForces2D

The Final Project report will consist of compilation and running instructions, my results from benchmarking
the size-dependence of my simulation reported in wallclock time, and a description of my serial and parallel
algorithms.
